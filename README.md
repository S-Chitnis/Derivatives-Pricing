# Derivatives-Pricing

The goal of this repository is to apply stochastic models to price derivatives and understand their inherent risks. Projects under this repository aim to understand three aspects of derivaties pricing -
1. Mathematical framework and specific tools (stochastic analysis, Fourier methods, fractional calculus),
2. numerical aspects (actual implementation of the models, optimization routines) and
3. data (calibration on real data, backward testing of hedging strategies)
